# VizSnap
Current version of VizSnap (as of March 25 2019) a blind friendly iPhone app designed to assist blind people in organizing and browsing a photo library without sight.
VizSnap records audio while the user is aiming the camera, and allows an optional voice memo to be recorded, to allow the user to give custom information to accompany the photo, as well as capturing time, date, and location the photo was taken. All this information is available to the user when browsing through VizSnapâ€™s photo library.

This is an XCode Project using Objective C. Pull the project, open with XCode, and build.
